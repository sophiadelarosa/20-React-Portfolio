# 20 React: React Portfolio

 a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies. 

You’ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to create a build that you can deploy.

**Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.
